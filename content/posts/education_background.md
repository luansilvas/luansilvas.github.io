# Educational background

## High School
I went to one of the best schools in the south of Sao Paulo, José Vieira de Moraes.

I had excellent teachers and made great friends. 

## College
As I Took the max benefit out of the classes, I was able to get a full scholarship on the Analysis and Development of Systems course at SENAC. 

The college was amazing, I had subjects about databases, logic, data structures, OOP and so on.

Every single semester I had to deliver an integrated project involving all the semester subjects.

## Language

### English - Advanced/Fluent

When I was fifteen, I went to Instituto Social Nossa Senhora de Fátima. My first yearof english class was amazing, i perfomed really well. That's why i made into the best students and i was granted an oportunity to have advanced english classes next year. 

In 2020 I started teaching english at Cidadão Pró-Mundo, an ONG that teaches english to students  that can't afford regular courses. And from jan/2023 to jun/23 I was a class owner, position that showed me that I have the potencial to be a great leader.


### Spanish - basic
